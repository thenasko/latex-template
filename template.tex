This is a simple template useful for starting LaTeX documents. All package includes and additional commands are defined in \texttt{customizations.sty}. Reading through it will help you write more efficiently. A lot of the custom commands are aimed at mathematcal writing, but they can be easily changed to suit different needs. Please make sure to copy \texttt{customizations.sty} along with any documents derived from this template.
